         deleteObserver(Observer o) methods of Observable. 
         Things also changed in the setBidAmount() method. 
         We now made calls to the setChanged() and notifyObservers() methods of the Observable class. 
         The setChanged() method marks this Observable object as having been changed while the notifyObservers() method,
          as its name suggests, notifies all of its observers about the change. For the observers, we need to implement 
          the Observer interface that have a single update(Observable o, Object arg) method. 
          This method gets called whenever the subject (Product) changes. Following is the modified Bidder class implementing 
          the Observer interface.
